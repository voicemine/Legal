Terms of Use
============
Thank you for using VoiceMine (“VoiceMine”). These are the terms of use (“Terms”), which apply to your use of the VoiceMine application(“App”) and the services available to you on the Site (“Services”).

#### Registration:

When you register with VoiceMine, you will be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information that we may request, all of which will become part of your profile and which you can add to or change from time to time. You will also be asked to select a screen name and password which will serve to identify you as a registered user each time you visit the Site and allow you to access your account. You may not (i) select or use a screen name of another person with intent to impersonate that person, (ii) use a screen name in which another person has rights without authorization from that person, or (iii) use a screen name that VoiceMine, at its sole discretion, deems offensive. You agree to provide (i) true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration form, and (ii) maintain and properly update your profile to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or VoiceMine has reasonable grounds to suspect that you have, we have the right to suspend or terminate your registration status and deny you future use of the Site and the Services (or any portion thereof).

#### Use of the App:

This App and the Services offered are intended for your personal, noncommercial use in accordance with these terms.

However, mistakes can happen. If you believe that your profile or activities are being displayed in a manner that you did not authorize, you can notify us of the error by using the “Contact Us” button on any page of the Site and we will correct the problem promptly.

# VoiceMine Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy governs VoiceMine (“we”, “us” or “VoiceMine”) treatment of personally identifiable information that VoiceMine collects when you use the VoiceMine.com webApp (the “App”), when you share information about yourself on our App as well as when you provide information to us in any medium.

##### Information we collect

##### User Provided Information

VoiceMine collects personal information from you when you register on the App, update your profile, interact with other users, and use various features of the App. To register with VoiceMine, you must provide a user name, password, native language, and email address. When you register you may also provide your country, gender, English ability and other information. Once you are a registered user of VoiceMine you may be given the option to add additional personal information to your profile. We may also collect information regarding your interaction with other users and your use of the App, including content you view linked from the App and VoiceMine points that you have earned, which will also be displayed on the App. From time to time we may ask you to respond to surveys or other requests for information, and we collect the information you provide. We may collect information from you when you participate in sweepstakes and promotions offered on the App. We use this information to continually offer you the most value as a user of the App.



##### Supplemental Information

We may supplement the information you provide us by acquiring commercially available demographic and marketing information from third parties, for instance, to update your information and to create a profile of your preferences. We may tie your personally identifiable information to information in the profile, in order to improve the content of the App for you or to inform you about products or services that we think will be of interest to you.

##### Advertisements

We may from time to time use various outside ad-serving companies and affiliates to serve advertisements on the App. In the process of serving advertisements, the ad serving companies may place a cookie in your browser's cookie file and may use information about your visits to the App and other webApps in order to provide advertisements on the App about products and services that may be of interest to you. By delivering ads on the App, the ad-server is able to record what ads a user -- identified by the unique cookie -- has seen, and what pages the user was viewing when the ads were delivered. This web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information the ad-server has collected from your visits to the App and other webApps not affiliated with VoiceMine. This non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad-serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you see online at the App and other webApps not affiliated with VoiceMine.

##### Surveys or Promotions.

From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes, contests or other promotions promoted on the App, which might be sponsored or conducted by VoiceMine or by a third party. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these promotions is completely voluntary and you will have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information. If there is a third party sponsor involved please make sure to review that third party's privacy policy.



### Use of Personal Information



##### When you register

When you register with VoiceMine, you can create your own profile. If your profile is visible, your profile information, as well as your name and picture are displayed to other registered users as well as visitors to the App.

##### Our Use

We receive and store any personal information you enter on the App or give to us voluntarily in any other way and may use it to contact you from time to time. This means we may contact you by email, phone and/or cell number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving (e.g. video etc.). We may also send you information or offers from time to time to a postal address or email address we have on file. If you provide your name for a promotional offer to enter a sweepstakes or contest, and win a prize, we will post a winner's list online, and will file your name with state agencies if required by law.

##### Vendors

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples might include sending email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links and providing customer service. They have access to your personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
